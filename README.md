# Code for "Geometric Pooling: A User's Guide"

This repo contains the code behind Figures 4 and 5 of "Geometric Pooling: A User's Guide". The Python code in `main.py` and `mod/` runs the simulations and stores the results as `.csv` files in `data/`. The R code in `data/viz.R` then processes those `.csv` files to generate the figures in `data/fig-4.png` and `data/fig-5.png`.
